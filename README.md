## 🧠 How It Works

- Users can enter expressions using on-screen buttons or keyboard.
- The `evaluate()` function parses the string expression and shows results.
- Voice input is processed through `webkitSpeechRecognition`, translating spoken phrases like “five plus seven” into `5 + 7`.
- Results are stored in a scrollable history section.
- Stylish 3D effects are powered by CSS hover transitions and `transform`.

## 🗣️ Voice Commands Supported

Say math phrases like:

> **“Eight divided by two plus five”**  
> **“Square root of sixteen”**  
> **“Six times nine”**

And NovaCalc will automatically compute and show the result!

## 💡 Inspiration
